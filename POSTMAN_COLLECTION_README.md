## Quick Start Test Workflow

Follow these steps to test the API:

### 1. Authentication

```bash
1. POST /api/auth/register (create account if needed)
2. POST /api/auth/login (login to get token)
3. Token auto-saves to {{AUTH_TOKEN}}
4. GET /api/auth/profile (verify you're logged in)
```

### 2. Create an Incident

```bash
POST /api/incidents
- Fill in title, description, category, location
- Response contains incident ID (save as {{INCIDENT_ID}})
```

### 3. Retrieve Your Incidents

```bash
GET /api/incidents/mine
- View all your submitted incidents
```

### 4. (Admin) Assign Incident

```bash
PATCH /api/incidents/:id/assign
- Replace :id with your {{INCIDENT_ID}}
- Provide {{OFFICER_ID}} to assign to
```

### 5. Send Alerts

```bash
POST /api/alerts/emergency
- Include title, message, location
- Receives notification
```

### 6. Ranger Operations (Officer/Admin)

```bash
1. GET /api/ranger/cases (view assigned cases)
2. POST /api/ranger/cases/:caseId/accept (accept mission)
3. POST /api/ranger/cases/:caseId/start-mission
4. POST /api/ranger/cases/:caseId/arrive-on-site
5. POST /api/ranger/cases/:caseId/evidence (upload photos)
```

## Role-Based Access

Different endpoints require different roles:

| Role        | Description                       | Can Access                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CITIZEN** | Regular users reporting incidents | Create incidents, view own incidents, awareness                |
| **OFFICER** | Law enforcement/rangers           | View all incidents, update status, create alerts, manage cases |
| **ADMIN**   | System administrators             | All endpoints, user management, assign incidents               |

## Authentication Header Format

All endpoints (except login/register/public endpoints) require:

```
Authorization: Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}
```

This is automatically included in the collection requests.

## Common Response Codes

| Code | Meaning                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| 200  | Success                              |
| 201  | Created successfully                 |
| 400  | Bad request (invalid data)           |
| 401  | Unauthorized (missing/invalid token) |
| 403  | Forbidden (insufficient permissions) |
| 404  | Not found                            |
| 500  | Server error                         |

## Testing Tips

1. **Use Variables** - Copy IDs from responses and paste into the {{}} brackets in requests
2. **Test in Order** - Login first, then test endpoints with your token
3. **Check Response** - Look at the Response tab to see returned data
4. **Use Tests** - Some requests have automated test scripts that save data to environment
5. **Monitor Logs** - Check server console for any errors
6. **Environment Toggle** - Can temporarily disable variables by unchecking them

## Troubleshooting

### "No token, authorization denied"

- You're missing the AUTH_TOKEN
- Run the Login request first
- Check that {{AUTH_TOKEN}} variable is set in your environment

### "Access denied: insufficient permissions"

- Your user role doesn't have permission for this endpoint
- Check if you're using the correct user role (Officer vs Admin vs Citizen)
- Verify your user role with GET /api/auth/profile

### "Invalid location format"

- Location must include latitude, longitude
- Use format: `{ "lat": 12.3456, "lng": 78.9012, "address": "Location name" }`

### Token Expired

- Re-run the Login request to get a new token
- It will auto-update {{AUTH_TOKEN}}

## Production Deployment

Before moving to production:

1. Create a new environment file with production BASE_URL
2. Update all sensitive values (API keys, URLs)
3. Test all critical workflows
4. Document any custom configurations
5. Keep backup of working collection
